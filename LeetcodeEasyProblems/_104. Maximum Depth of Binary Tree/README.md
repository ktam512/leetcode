## Key

- A pretty easy problem, we just need to handle the base case by answering the question:
    - What is the depth of a tree with no node? The answer is 0
    - And a tree with 1 node? Itâ€™s 1. And so on and so forth.
- Also have to remember how to do the dfs function. This is one of the many problems which we can call the function itself.
